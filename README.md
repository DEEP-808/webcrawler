# webcrawler
The web crawler runs on a local device and saves the output into a file 
this file is displayed as a table in the browser the site is yet to be hosted 
all the scraped data is displayed as table trough client side js 

Future devolopements :
-> after the site is hosted and the more data is collected the display table will be created at the server directly, changing the index html file and speeding up the procees
-> crawler for multiple sites will be made
